# UltrakULL

**UltrakULL** (ULTRAKILL Language Library) is a modification (mod) for ULTRAKILL that allows for modification of the game's text strings,
effectively allowing for translation and localization into various languages.\
This mod's primary purpose is to bridge the gap for localization and translation until ULTRAKILL recieves official translations.

# Features

- Translates the entire game from English to any language
- Support for multiple languages
- JSON formatting of language files allows for easy-to-understand, simple-to-do modification of strings
- Change languages directly in-game without having to restart
- Languages are consistently developed and updated for a faithful localization and translation of the original game text


# Download

UltrakULL and can be be obtained either through the [Releases page](https://github.com/ClearwaterTM/UltrakULL/releases) (*recommended*),
or via the [UltrakULL Discord.](https://discord.gg/ZB7jk6Djv5)
Additional language files can be obtained in the [Languages](#Languages) section,
or via the [UltrakULL Discord](https://discord.gg/ZB7jk6Djv5) in the #language-releases channel.

# Installation

### Prerequisites:
- A [Steam copy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/) of ULTRAKILL.<br>**Demo, GOG.com and cracked versions are NOT supported.**
- BepInEx 5 64-bit. It can be directly downloaded from [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.21/BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0.zip).<br>**Do not download/install BepInEx 6, ULTRAKILL does not support it.**
- A release of UltrakULL. Details to obtain it are given in the [Download](#Download) section.<br>**It is highly recommended to acquire the latest version available when downloading.**
- (Optional) Any extra language files you may wish to use. View the [Download](#Download) section for information on extra language files.

### Installation:
- Download UltrakULL from either the [Releases page](https://github.com/ClearwaterTM/UltrakULL/releases) or the #mod-releases channel from the [UltrakULL Discord.](https://discord.gg/ZB7jk6Djv5)
- Download BepInEx 5, and extract the contents to where your ULTRAKILL install folder is located. 
- Launch ULTRAKILL once so BepInEx can generate the required files and folders in the install folder. Quit the game once it has loaded to the main menu.
- Extract the contents of UltrakULL to your BepInEx folder. Overwrite any files if prompted.
  - If you have any additional language files, place them in BepInEx/config/ultrakull .
- Launch ULTRAKILL. If the mod has loaded correctly, you should see a new "Languages" tab in the options menu.

# Documentation

GitHub documentation coming soon. Until then, documentation on how to create your own language
can be found in the [UltrakULL Discord.](https://discord.gg/ZB7jk6Djv5)

# Building

Build instructions coming soon.

# Troubleshooting

### ULTRAKILL received an update, and UltrakULL is now broken/not working correctly.
As is the case with most updates for other games,
any and all updates and hotfixes to ULTRAKILL will almost certainly break mod functionality
to some degree. Work to future-proof the mod as much as possible is done to minimise such occurrences,
but if an update breaks the mod, it will be fixed as quickly as possible.

### My language does not appear as selectable in-game in the language tab.

Language files are formatted in JSON. If it does not appear as available, it is either not formatted correctly
or does not match the minimum version required by the mod.\
To check if a file is formatted correctly, open [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) in your browser, copy and paste the contents
of your file into the window and click on "Validate JSON". \
If the file is not formatted correctly, JSONLint will report any errors.
Errors can be forwarded to the UltrakULL Discord's troubleshooting channel for assistance.

### My problem is not listed here.

A dedicated troubleshooting and support channel can be found at the [UltrakULL Discord](https://discord.gg/ZB7jk6Djv5).

# FAQ

### Can I translate ULTRAKILL into my native language with this mod?

Indeed you can! Thanks to this mod, ULTRAKILL has already been translated into various foreign languages,
including French, Brazilian Portugese, Traditional Chinese, with many other languages also in development at the time of release.\
If you wish to contribute to, or begin work on a new or existing translation or language, feel free to stop by and inquire
at the [UltrakULL Discord.](https://discord.gg/ZB7jk6Djv5)

### Will this mod affect my saves?

No, this mod merely changes text in the game. It does not alter your saves in any way.

### Will this mod prevent Cybergrind highscores?

No, for the same reason as above. It does not alter any gameplay aspects that would give an unfair advantage in any way, and as such,
will be safe to set Cybergrind highscores with.

### Can voice lines from characters be translated?

It's indeed possible to swap out audio clips as other mods have already accomplished this,
so it should also be able to be applied to speaking characters. UltrakULL does not currently support this, but it
is a feature that I would like to implement in future.

### Where can I follow UltrakULL's development?
I usually like to post updates and news about development in multiple places, including the [UltrakULL Discord](https://discord.gg/ZB7jk6Djv5) itself,
the [New Blood Discord](https://discord.gg/newblood), and my [personal Twitter](https://twitter.com/ClearwaterHLL).

### Is UltrakULL compatible with other mods?
[Ultrakill Mod Manager](https://github.com/Temperz87/ultra-mod-manager): Confirmed to be working, however has not been fully tested.\
Compatability with other mods not listed here is unknown.
